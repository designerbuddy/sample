DESIGNERS ARE WELCOME FROM AROUND THE WORLD<br>
<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt = ""/>

<p>I am a Designer and i feel we all designers sort of need a platform where we can share our work with eachother and improve as there would be a generation of designers </p>

<p>My passion is to be a conceptual designer and i would like to talk about myself a little and would be great if i geta chance to learn more about you designers. This is Rida from karachi im creating a site for creating an enviroment for everyone so that they feel relaxed. </p>

<p> As i believed designers are never taken seriously and the peer presure they have been given is unimaginable. And this the the platform where people can talk and discuss their ideas with eachother and try to make things better and easier. happy Designing!! You all ;) </p>
